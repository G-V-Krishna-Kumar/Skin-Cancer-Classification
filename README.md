# Skin-Cancer-Classification

## Technical Overview

### Problem Statement
Early detection identified by dermoscopy images significantly decreases the mortality rate from skin cancer. However, the accuracy of system diagnosis is impacted by multiple factors, including image quality affected by noises, brightness variations, initial digitalization, and sampling.

### Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we suggest a method to reduce the possibility of erroneous diagnosis. Our approach involves the following technical steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Techniques**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning techniques.
   - **Purpose**: For data visualization, preprocessing, and augmentation.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - **Objective**: To accelerate the rate of reorganization by eliminating all irrelevant textures.

### Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved a 96% accuracy rate with a 4% margin of error.
- **Precision**: 85%
- **F1 Score**: 87%
